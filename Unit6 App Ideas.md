# App Idea 1: Routes&Sights - Fabio Hernandez Rubio

**What:** Routes&Sights is an app that allows users to create exploration paths in places like cities or towns. Users can then follow these paths and rate them.

**Who:** The app is targeted to tourists to help them get to know the city with the help of the local's wisdom. Another target for the app are obviously the locals who want to share the beauty of their city or town.

**Why:** We are building this app to provide users with a custom experience when visiting new towns or cities. Rather than only going to the most famous and touristy places, users can get a unique experience.

**Challenges:** Some potential challenges could be low user engagement from part of the locals to provide routes. Rewarding these users should alliviate the problem

# App Idea 2: GymFit - Jinming Liu:

**Use**: Provide varity of workouts depending on your body goals and fitness goals

**Who**: people that wants to get into fitness or looking for new types of workouts

**Why**: There are not many fitness apps in the market, we want to provide a personal plan for each person depending on their goals

**Challenges**: Some potential challenges we can run into is that maybe the workout can be similar from other fitness applications. But we will provide all the best workout depending on your goal and body type.

# App Idea 3: ColorSound - Augusto Rodriguez:

**Use**: User can pick a color they are feeling like and the app will play music that matches that color.

**Who**: People that want to listen to a certain type of music but do not know how to find it.

**Why**: I feel like all music apps just give you the freedom of choosing whatever music you have or want but dont suggest music based on a certain color.

**Challenges**: Some challenges would be figuring out what music to play depending on the color that the person uses. Also seeing how to give users a log in as well as copyrights for the music being played.

# App Idea 4: Team Generator - Anthony Khera

**Use**: Create teams for large groups either randomly or using a skill based matchmaking algorithm. Users can also set rules such as the number of consecutive games someone can be assigned to sit out of before the app automatically assigns them to play.

**Who**: People that like to play competitive games like Pickleball, Spikeball, Tennis, etc. with groups of friends. 

**Why**: When I play Spikeball with my friends, if we have 6 people and only 4 can play at a time it would be nice to have an app that not only randomly creates the team but tracks how many times someone has played or sat in a row and if someone has sat out twice in a row, it will automatically put them in the next game.

**Challenges**: The biggest challenge would be divising the skill based matchmaking algorithm. If players self assign skill levels there would need to be a way to create fair matches using those skill levels but not having them be the exact same teams every time.

# App Idea 5: LinguaEngage - Alex Rodriguez

**Use**: Users can select a language, then list their hobbies and the app will create daily phrases that talk about the hobbies in the selected language.

**Who**: Anyone that wants to learn a new language in a fun way.

**Why**: When people are learning a new language they find it difficult to talk about their interests/hobbies since they might not know the correct vocabulary. This app will allow users to learn new vocabulary and phrases in topics that they are interested in so the users find learning a new language fun and interactive. 

**Challenges**: The biggest challenge would be to generate phrases related to the interests the user slects, since we would need to use a huge database that contains a lot of phrases for many hobbies.
